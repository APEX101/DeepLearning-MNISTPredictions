# MNISTDataset Predicitons-CNN



## 📝 Overview
 
 Prediction on the famous MNIST dataset.The MNIST database of handwritten digits,  It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. 
Predicts the number from the image of numbers provided.
## 🧰 Technical Aspects

- Traning on GoogleColab.
- Image Data preprocessing.
- Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Image Data Normalization and Scaling.
<!-- - Using Image Data generator for Image Data Augmentation and ImageDataGenerator flow from directory for Class Batch Division to  train on. -->
- Training using Sequential Model with Conv2D,MaxPool2D,Flatten and Dense Layers , with output layer having Softmax activation.

- Compiled using AdamOptmizer as optmizer and categorical_crossentropy as the loss function as its multi class classification problem.
- Solving Overfitting issues using EarlyStoppings Callbacks and Dropout Layers in Network.
- Hyperparameter Tuning the Algorithms yielding best results.
- Testing the model on custom reallife Image data.
